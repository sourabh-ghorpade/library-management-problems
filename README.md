### Preface:

**Project Overview: Library Book Management System**

Welcome to the Library Book Management System project interview task. You will be provided with a console-based Library Book Management System codebase with potential bugs. Your goal is to enhance this code, apply clean code practices, structure it within a project, and ensure it can be built and run successfully. You can use any of the provided codes in the supported languages. e.g. If you want to use golang then use librarian.go, if ruby then librarian.rb etc. You do not have to write the code from scratch. The requirements for this codebase are provided in requirements.md

### Task Description:


**Code Improvement and Refactoring:**

Your task is to identify and fix potential issues in the provided code. Some functionality might be missing, do implement that as well Additionally, refactor the codebase, adhering to clean code principles, and enhancing its readability. Please add unit tests cases and ensure coverage of > 90%  with a standard test coverage tool.

**Project Structure and Build System:**

Create a well-structured project layout based on your chosen programming language in a new repository. Set up a build system to compile and run the code. Then copy the code file provided into it and then fix the bugs and refactor it. You may create more files/classes as required.

**Documentation:**

Include in-code comments and provide a README that explains setup, build, and execution instructions.

**Executable Code:**

Ensure that the code is executable without errors. The program should not crash at any point.

### Submission:

Submit your improved code, project structure, build system, and README. You can use any of the supported languages.

### Evaluation:

You will be assessed based on code quality, adherence to clean code practices, project structure, build system setup, and functionality correctness.
